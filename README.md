# Dockerizing Django with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx

### Development

Uses the default Django development server.
1. Build the images and run the containers:

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    Test it out at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The "app" folder is mounted into the container and your code changes apply automatically.

### Production

Uses gunicorn + nginx.
1. Build the images and run the containers:

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
    ```

    Test it out at [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337). No mounted folders. To apply changes, the image must be re-built.
